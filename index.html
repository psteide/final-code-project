                My name is Parnell Steide, and I was born and raised in New Jersey, but I currently live in Florida. As someone who’s culturally mixed, I love to mix and match different aspects of life. My two main interests in life, technology and reptile keeping may seem contradictory, but I find that I like the balance that can be found between them. I have been with ford credit almost 6 years, and I started in the Investigations department and worked my way up to become a Commercial Discrepancy Specialist in funding.

                I want to be a software engineer, because I truly believe it is the future. Technology is all around us, and while we haven’t exactly mastered flying cars yet, it is vastly integrated in our daily lives and I am excited about that. Ever since I was a child I have been captivated by technology, from taking apart my second hand Super Nintendo system to loading up linux on an old laptop I thought was otherwise garbage. Even over the last 6 weeks web design has become something that was something I remember messing with as kid, to something I’ve really become invested in. There is something really satisfying in creating something literally out of thin air. I am vivaciously excited to continue to learn even more than I already have.
